# :shell: Learning GraphQL by building a book query API :shell:

In this project I will be using GraphQL primarily to experiment with alternatives to RESTFUL design practices. I will also be using react and Django, both of which I have minimal experience with to further my learning in other frameworks.

This project was created using a tool I built: [`synth`](https://github.com/bennettdixon/synth)
